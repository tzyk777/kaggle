1. Vectorized data, filled na value with mean
2. Some problems were found when I using lasso regression to select features, I tried l1 penalty ranges from 0.05 to 75, the best model 
according to cross validation is found when penalty is 30, however, when I using the best penlty to train a model on the training data set,
the large number coefficients indicate overfitting problem.
3. Need to study more masteries about feature engineering and selection
